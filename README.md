## Overview
 As a developer, there are some things to do to honor the community:
- Start with the classic "Hello, world!" for your first attempts.
- Make sure to mark your "First commit" when you commit your code.
- Embrace the developer lifestyle: having no life and no friends (just kidding!).
- And of course, don't forget about the calculator! You have to write your own calculator. 
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
